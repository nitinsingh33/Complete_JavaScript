### Sync v/s Async

## Synchronous
Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program. Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.

## Asynchronous
Due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the UI. Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.
